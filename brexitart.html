			</center>
			<p class = "artpara">On 26 July 2016, just over one month after the Brexit Referendum, Enda Kenny had lunch with British Prime Minister Theresa May in Downing Street.  Afterwards, the former taoiseach said: "We are both agreed very firmly there will be no return to a hard border as existed. In the months that followed, Dublin, London and Brussels re-emphasised that determination at every turn. Everyone would protect the peace process and avoid any return to the "borders of the past". So how is it that the hard fought solution to preserve the peace should now be vilified as the "hated" backstop, a "trap" that would keep the UK in the EU "forever", that would "divide" the United Kingdom, and threaten to pitch all of Europe off a cliff edge into a potentially calamitous No Deal scenario? "It is only on reading the Attorney General’s legal advice about the implications of the Northern Ireland 'backstop' in the Brexit deal," intoned the Daily Telegraph this week, "that the true enormity of what the government has agreed to becomes apparent." To understand how we got here, we need to return to the Joint Report, published one year ago this week. The Joint Report contains the embryo of the backstop, but as this blog has pointed out before, it held a fateful ambiguity. 
			</p> 
			<p class = "artpara">
			Paragraph 49 of the report stated that, if no other solutions were to be found: "The United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement." Was this the UK as a whole aligning? Or was it just the UK aligning on behalf of Northern Ireland? To Dublin and the EU, it was clear. The backstop was for Northern Ireland only.  However, to London the UK as a whole could "align" in a backstop scenario. At the time, the ambiguity did not go unnoticed."In any event, there was no great drama about the idea that the UK as a whole would "align" with the EU in a backstop scenario, if that was indeed what Paragraph 49 meant.But there was a very discreet hint during Theresa May’s appearance before the House of Commons on 18 December.Labour MP Stephen Timms crisply asked Mrs May if the "full alignment with those rules of the internal market and the customs union" would apply "just to Northern Ireland, or to the UK as a whole?"The Prime Minister repeated her belief that a hard border could be avoided through the overall relationship, or specific solutions (technology) or "failing that, we will move to the concept of full alignment, which is about having the same objectives on both sides".She added that the Joint Report made it clear how it would operate: "It could be UK-wide or, with the agreement of the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, it could be specific to Northern Ireland." Was Mrs May hedging her bets? Either way, the House did not erupt in fury, and all sides retired for Christmas. On 27 February the European Commission published the first draft of the Withdrawal Agreement, setting out how a Northern Ireland-specific backstop would work. It was immediately rejected by Theresa May and the DUP. It was at this point that British negotiators turned the ambiguity of Paragraph 49 into an opportunity. Could the wording that "the UK will align…" be used for customs, but not for the single market? "There are already regulatory differences between GB and Northern Ireland," said one senior British source, "so some of that will be acceptable. But you can’t put a customs border down the Irish Sea." According to two sources close to the negotiations, London ran the idea of a UK-wide solution to the backstop past Dublin first, before putting it to the European Commission. Dublin was open to the idea. Ireland still disputed London’s interpretation of Paragraph 49 (if it had intended to be a UK-wide entity, then what was the use of Paragraph 50, spelling out unfettered trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain?).
