			Catching Feelings, Nominated for the World Fiction Award at the Los Angeles Film Festival, Kagiso Lediga’s Catching Feelings is a dark romantic comedy centring on a married couple whose lives are turned upside down when a hedonistic older writer moves into their home. Decider’s own Joe Reid gave the film a “stream it” recommendation, praising the film’s dialogue and calling it a “light little escape from a fresh comedic voice.”

Per Netflix, the film follows women who’ve been sexually brutalised in war-torn Congo who begin to heal at City of Joy, a centre that helps them regain a sense of self and empowerment.
