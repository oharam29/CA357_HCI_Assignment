			<p class = "artpara">MANCHESTER UNITED boss Jose Mourinho has denied there was ever a rift between him and Â£89million man Paul Pogba. Rumours have swirled all season that Mourinho and his maverick French midfielder have had a series of bust-ups. But Mourinho has described Pogba as "polite" and hit out at "lies in journalism". Speaking ahead of United's eagerly-anticipated Premier League clash this weekend against Arsenal, Mourinho told ESPN Brazil: "If that happened 10 or 15 years back, it would bother me a lot. "Because in that time it wouldn't have lies in journalism. "Actually, I don't even know who's a journalist and who isn't anymore, because nowadays anyone can be a journalist. In fact, me and Paul never had a personal issue

			<p class = "artpara">
			"If you tell me that we would have problems because me, as a coach, create different things than someone else and vice versa, OK, but personal issues, absolutely not. "I feel happy to say that Paul can be a lot of things, but there's a thing I can assure you: he's very polite." United have been linked with a summer swoop for Chelsea midfielder Willian, and unsurprisingly Mourinho was quizzed about the prospect of signing the Brazilian. But he poured cold water on bringing the 29-year-old to Old Trafford, instead focusing on the attributes Brazilians in general bring to the pitch after links to Fred and Alex Sandro.
