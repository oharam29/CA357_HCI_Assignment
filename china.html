			<p class = "artpara">SHANGHAI, CHINAâ€”China's ambitious program of lunar exploration is about to attempt a spacefaring first: On 8 December it will launch a probe intended to land on the far side of the moon. Besides boasting rights, the Chang'e-4 lander and rover are expected to produce a host of new insights into the moon's composition and history. "Chang'e-4 is an historical mission," says Bernard Foing, director of the European Space Agency's (ESA's) International Lunar Exploration Working Group in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. Remote observations have shown that the far side of the moon, invisible from Earth, has a much thicker, older crust and is pockmarked by more and deeper craters than the near side, where large dark plains called maria, formed by ancient lava flows, have erased much of the cratering. The big difference "is still a mystery," Foing says, and Chang'e's trip "can give clues."

			China started its lunar program 3 decades after the United States and the Soviet Union ended theirs. Chinese geologists eager to study the moon convinced the government to establish the Lunar Exploration Program under the China National Space Administration (CNSA) in 2004. The agency launched Chang'e-1 and Chang'e-2, named after a Chinese moon goddess, in 2007 and 2010, respectively; both produced "a lot of good science," including high-resolution lunar images and new altimetry measurements, says planetary scientist James Head of Brown University.

			In 2013, Chang'e-3 became the first craft to land on the moon since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 sample return mission in 1976. The lander and the small rover it carried gathered data on the moon's topography, mineralogy, and elemental abundance. In a first, the rover was equipped with a ground-penetrating radar that profiled buried lava flows and regolith, the broken up rock and dust that makes up the lunar soil. Chang'e-4 was designed as an identical backup to Chang'e-3, but when that mission proved successful, China's planners became more ambitious. Going to the far side promised "unique and original science" as well as a chance to "develop China's deep space observational capabilities," says Li Chunlai, deputy director-general of the Chinese Academy of Sciences's National Astronomical Observatories of China (NAOC) in Beijing, which advises CNSA on the program's science objectives.
